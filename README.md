# Comprehensive Guide to Python Type Covariance and Contravariance with Hands-on Examples

Youâ€™ve asked for a deep dive into Pythonâ€™s type covariance and contravariance, complete with experimental code examples to get your hands dirty and fully grasp the motivation behind these concepts. This guide is designed to be comprehensive, self-contained, and practical, blending theory with exercises you can run yourself. Weâ€™ll explore what covariance and contravariance mean, why they matter, and how to implement them in Python using the `typing` module and the `mypy` type checker. Letâ€™s roll up our sleeves and get started!

---

## Introduction: What Are Covariance and Contravariance?

Covariance and contravariance are concepts from type theory that describe how generic types (like `List[T]` or custom classes) behave when their type parameters are related by inheritance. Theyâ€™re crucial in Pythonâ€™s type hinting system, introduced with PEP 484, to ensure type safety while maintaining flexibility in generic programming.

- **Covariance**: If `Cat` is a subtype of `Animal`, a covariant generic type allows `Container[Cat]` to be treated as a subtype of `Container[Animal]`. This is perfect for read-only scenarios, where youâ€™re retrieving values but not modifying them.
- **Contravariance**: Conversely, if `Cat` is a subtype of `Animal`, a contravariant generic type allows `Container[Animal]` to be used where `Container[Cat]` is expected. This fits write-only or consumer scenarios, like functions taking parameters.
- **Invariance**: By default, Python generic types are invariant, meaning `Container[Cat]` and `Container[Animal]` are unrelated unless explicitly specified otherwise.

These properties are controlled in Python using `TypeVar` from the `typing` module, with options like `covariant=True` or `contravariant=True`. To see why this matters, letâ€™s set up our environment and dive into some hands-on experiments.

---

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before we begin, youâ€™ll need:

1. **Python 3.7+**: Type hints work best in modern versions.
2. **`mypy`**: A static type checker to enforce our type rules.
Install it with:
    
    ```bash
    pip install mypy
    
    ```
    
3. **A Code Editor**: Any will doâ€”VSCode, PyCharm, or even a text editor with a terminal.

Weâ€™ll also define some base classes for our experiments:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name

class Cat(Animal):
    def meow(self):
        print("Meow!")

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("Bark!")

```

Save this in a file (e.g., `animals.py`)â€”weâ€™ll import it later. Now, letâ€™s explore covariance and contravariance through practical examples.

---

## Experiment 1: Covariance with Read-Only Collections

### Motivation

Imagine you have a list of `Cat` objects, and you want to pass it to a function expecting a list of `Animal` objects, since every `Cat` is an `Animal`. This should be safe if youâ€™re only *reading* from the list (e.g., getting elements), because you wonâ€™t add a `Dog` to a list of cats. Covariance makes this possible.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

The issue with 'adding a Dog to a list of cats' arises with *mutable* lists. If a list meant for `Cat` objects could have a `Dog` added (by having a method like `add` to add `Dog` object to `ReadOnlyList[Cat]` ), it would violate type safety, as the list would contain an unexpected type.

</aside>

### Code Example

Letâ€™s create a `ReadOnlyList` thatâ€™s covariant in its type parameter `T`:

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic, List

T = TypeVar("T", covariant=True)

class ReadOnlyList(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, items: List[T]):
        self.items = items

    def get(self, index: int) -> T:
        return self.items[index]

# Create a list of cats
cat_list = ReadOnlyList([Cat("Kitty")])

# Assign it to a variable expecting animals
animal_list: ReadOnlyList[Animal] = cat_list

# Access it
print(animal_list.get(0).name)  # Output: Kitty

```

Save this as `covariance.py` and run:

```bash
mypy covariance.py

```

If allâ€™s well, `mypy` reports no errors. Then execute:

```bash
python covariance.py

```

Youâ€™ll see "Kitty" printed.

### Whatâ€™s Happening?

- `T` is marked `covariant=True`, so `ReadOnlyList[Cat]` is a subtype of `ReadOnlyList[Animal]`.
- Since weâ€™re only reading (via `get`), itâ€™s safe to treat a list of cats as a list of animals.

### Experiment: Remove Covariance

Change `T = TypeVar("T", covariant=True)` to `T = TypeVar("T")` and run `mypy` again:

```
error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "ReadOnlyList[Cat]", variable has type "ReadOnlyList[Animal]")

```

Without covariance, Pythonâ€™s type system is invariant by default, rejecting the assignment. This shows why covariance is necessary for read-only flexibility.

## Experiment 2: Contravariance with Consumers

### Motivation

Now suppose you have a function that feeds a `Cat` to a consumer. If you have a consumer that can handle any `Animal`, it should work for a `Cat` too, since cats are animals. Contravariance enables this by allowing a consumer of a supertype to substitute for a consumer of a subtype.

### Code Example

Letâ€™s define a contravariant `Consumer`:

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar("T", contravariant=True)

class Consumer(Generic[T]):
    def consume(self, item: T) -> None:
        pass

class AnimalConsumer(Consumer[Animal]):
    def consume(self, item: Animal) -> None:
        print(f"Consuming {item.name}")

def feed_cat(consumer: Consumer[Cat]) -> None:
    consumer.consume(Cat("Kitty"))

# Create an animal consumer
animal_consumer = AnimalConsumer()

# Use it where a cat consumer is expected
feed_cat(animal_consumer)  # Output: Consuming Kitty

```

Save as `contravariance.py`, then:

```bash
mypy contravariance.py  # No errors
python contravariance.py  # Runs fine

```

### Whatâ€™s Happening?

- `T` is `contravariant=True`, so `Consumer[Animal]` can be used as a `Consumer[Cat]`.
- An `AnimalConsumer` can consume any animal, including cats, making this substitution safe.

### Experiment: Remove Contravariance

Set `T = TypeVar("T")` and re-run `mypy`:

```
error: Argument 1 to "feed_cat" has incompatible type "AnimalConsumer"; expected "Consumer[Cat]"

```

Without contravariance, the type system forbids this, showing its role in enabling flexible parameter handling.

## Experiment 3: Invariance with Mutable Collections

### Motivation

Pythonâ€™s built-in `list` is invariantâ€”`List[Cat]` isnâ€™t a `List[Animal]`â€”because itâ€™s mutable. Why? If it were covariant, you could add a `Dog` to a `List[Cat]`, breaking type safety. Letâ€™s see this in action.

### Code Example

```python
from typing import List

def print_animals(animals: List[Animal]) -> None:
    for animal in animals:
        print(animal.name)

cat_list: List[Cat] = [Cat("Kitty")]
print_animals(cat_list)  # mypy will complain

```

Save as `invariance.py` and run:

```bash
mypy invariance.py

```

Output:

```
error: Argument 1 to "print_animals" has incompatible type "List[Cat]"; expected "List[Animal]"

```

### Why Invariance?

If `List` were covariant, this would be allowed:

```python
def add_dog(animals: List[Animal]) -> None:
    animals.append(Dog("Fido"))

cat_list: List[Cat] = [Cat("Kitty")]
add_dog(cat_list)  # Adds a Dog to a Cat listâ€”disaster!

```

Invariance prevents this, ensuring type safety for mutable structures.

## Experiment 4: Combining Variance with Callables

### Motivation

Functions often involve both inputs (contravariant) and outputs (covariant). Letâ€™s explore this with `Callable`.

### Code Example

```python
from typing import Callable

def animal_to_str(animal: Animal) -> str:
    return animal.name

def use_cat_function(func: Callable[[Cat], str]) -> None:
    print(func(Cat("Kitty")))

use_cat_function(animal_to_str)  # Output: Kitty

```

Save as `callable.py`:

```bash
mypy callable.py  # No errors
python callable.py  # Works

```

### Whatâ€™s Happening?

- `Callable[[T], R]` is contravariant in `T` (parameters) and covariant in `R` (return type).
- A function taking `Animal` works where one taking `Cat` is expected, due to contravariance.

---

## Experiment 5: Mixing Covariance and Contravariance

### Motivation

What if a class both reads and writes? Letâ€™s test a `Processor` and see why itâ€™s invariant by default.

### Code Example

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar("T")

class Processor(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, value: T):
        self.value = value

    def get(self) -> T:
        return self.value

    def set(self, value: T) -> None:
        self.value = value

cat_processor = Processor(Cat("Kitty"))
animal_processor: Processor[Animal] = cat_processor  # mypy error

```

Save as `mixed.py`

Run `mypy`:

```
error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "Processor[Cat]", variable has type "Processor[Animal]")

```

### Fix with Separation

Separate reading and writing:

```python
R = TypeVar("R", covariant=True)
W = TypeVar("W", contravariant=True)

class Reader(Generic[R]):
    def get(self) -> R:
        pass

class Writer(Generic[W]):
    def set(self, value: W) -> None:
        pass

```

Now you can use variance appropriately for each role.

---

## When to Use Each

- **Covariance**: Read-only collections (`List[Cat]` as `List[Animal]`).
- **Contravariance**: Consumers or functions taking parameters (`Consumer[Animal]` for `Consumer[Cat]`).
- **Invariance**: Mutable types or when both reading and writing occur.

| Scenario | Variance | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only | Covariant | `ReadOnlyList[Cat]` to `Animal` |
| Write-only | Contravariant | `Consumer[Animal]` for `Cat` |
| Read and Write | Invariant | `List[Cat]` not related to `Animal` |

---

## Conclusion

Through these experiments, youâ€™ve seen:

- **Covariance** enables subtype flexibility for outputs.
- **Contravariance** allows supertype flexibility for inputs.
- **Invariance** protects mutable types.

Run these examples, tweak them (e.g., add methods, change variance), and check with `mypy` to deepen your understanding. For more, explore:

- [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)
